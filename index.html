    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Greetings readers. I am Luis Arreaga, and I am here to tell you about myself.<br>
      I only put this together to practice HTML, but maybe this will serve as an <br>
      interesting free-writing exercise. Who knows. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      I was born in Spain, but left when I was only five months old. I went directly to Switzerland <br>
      for the next three years, and then to Virginia, U.S. for four. Afterwards, I moved to Vancouver <br> 
      to live for another three years, and then Panama after that, once again for three years.<br>
      I went back to Virginia for another two years, and then moved to Iceland when I was 16.<br>
      I did not leave Iceland until I was 23. I am now living in Tallinn, Estonia, and am approaching <br>
        the one year mark. Who knows how long I'll stay, right? <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm not going to rank all the places I've lived in terms of how much I liked them, and would want to go back. <br>
      Madrid and Geneva are not on here because I hardly remember them.
    </p>

        Now, I'm going to test my HTML skills even further by creating a guide to how I make banana bread. <br>
        Even though this is the only recipe on the page, I'm going to structure as if it's part of a <br>
        bigger cook book.

    <h4>First Post</h4>
    
    <p class="post-date">Posted July 23, 2018</p>
    
    <p>Preface: This is more practice for me. Honestly, I don't care about blogging all that much.</p>
    
    <p>I spent a lot of the day learning about PrestaShop, which is turning out to be extremely difficult. It uses a lot of PHP terminology which is unfortunate because I've never used PHP before. Roxana called me, and told that I will have a meeting with Pablo at 14:00 to work with PrestaShop. Hopefully he'll explain more to me. Otherwise, I've spent the day revising a bunch of HTML and CSS properties. It's a good thing too, because apparently I will be working with a lot of these. Now, what if it isn't enough? I hope the tasks I have are simple enough, because this is truly the first time I will be applying this to a professsional setting. I guess we'll see. I'll be back later to post another blog.</p>
    
    <p class="post-date">Posted July 23, 2018</p>
      
    <p>Well that wasn't so bad, though not in the way I expected. Pablo came over to show me the ropes, but unfortunately (and fortunately for my anxiety), the programs weren't working. So he just described what I had to do, and asked if I knew SQL. Obviously, I said I didn't know anything about it, thus appeared my next task - learn SQL. I mean, how about that? I think this will be fun. I will be using <a target="_blank"href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql">Khan Academy</a> to learn SQL. I tried a bit today, and it will take some getting used to.</p>
